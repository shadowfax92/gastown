# Agent Lifecycle

> Understanding the three-layer architecture of agent workers

## Overview

Agents have three distinct lifecycle layers that operate independently. The
key design principle: **agents are persistent**. They survive work completion
and can be reused across assignments.

## The Four Operating States

Agents have four operating states:

| State | Description | How it happens |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Working** | Actively doing assigned work | Normal operation after `gt sling` |
| **Idle** | Work completed, sandbox preserved for reuse | After `gt done` completes successfully |
| **Stalled** | Session stopped mid-work | Interrupted, crashed, or timed out without being nudged |
| **Zombie** | Completed work but failed to exit | `gt done` failed during cleanup |

**State cycle (happy path):**

```
         ┌──────────┐
    ┌───>│  IDLE    │<──── sync sandbox to main, clear hook
    │    └────┬─────┘
    │         │ gt sling
    │         v
    │    ┌──────────┐
    │    │ WORKING  │<──── session active, hook set
    │    └────┬─────┘
    │         │ gt done
    │         v
    │    ┌──────────┐
    └────┤  IDLE    │──── push branch, submit MR, go idle
         └──────────┘
```

No `nuke` in the happy path. Agents cycle: IDLE -> WORKING -> IDLE.

**Key distinctions:**

- **Working** = actively executing. Session alive, hook set, doing work.
- **Idle** = work done, session killed, sandbox preserved. Ready for next `gt sling`.
- **Stalled** = supposed to be working, but stopped. Needs QA Engineer intervention.
- **Zombie** = finished work, tried to exit, but cleanup failed. Stuck in limbo.

## The Persistent Agent Model (gt-4ac)

**Agents persist after completing work.** When a agent finishes its assignment:

1. Signals completion via `gt done`
2. Pushes branch, submits MR to merge queue
3. Clears its hook (work is done)
4. Sets agent state to "idle"
5. Kills its own session
6. **Sandbox (worktree) is preserved for reuse**

The next `gt sling` reuses idle agents before allocating new ones, avoiding
the overhead of creating fresh worktrees.

### Why Persistent?

- **Faster turnaround** — Reusing an existing worktree is faster than creating one
- **Preserved identity** — The agent's agent ticket, CV chain, and work history persist
- **Simpler lifecycle** — No nuke/respawn cycle between assignments
- **Done means idle** — Session dies, sandbox lives, agent awaits next assignment

### What About Pending Merges?

The Release Engineer owns the merge queue. Once `gt done` submits work:
- The branch is pushed to origin
- Work exists in the MQ, not in the agent
- If rebase fails, Release Engineer creates a conflict-resolution task
- The idle agent can be reused for the conflict resolution work

## The Three Layers

### The Problem: Three Concepts Were Conflated

Early designs treated agents as monolithic. This caused recurring tickets:

| Concept | Lifecycle | Old behavior |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Identity** | Long-lived (name, CV, ledger) | Destroyed on nuke |
| **Sandbox** | Per-assignment (worktree, branch) | Destroyed on nuke |
| **Session** | Ephemeral (Claude context window) | = agent lifetime |

Separating these three layers means idle agents are a healthy state (not waste),
eliminates unnecessary worktree creation overhead, and preserves capability
records (CV, completion history) across assignments.

### Layer Summary

| Layer | Component | Lifecycle | Persistence |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Identity** | Agent ticket, CV chain, work history | Permanent | Never dies |
| **Sandbox** | Git worktree, branch | Persistent across assignments | Created on first sling, reused thereafter |
| **Session** | Claude (tmux pane), context window | Ephemeral per step | Cycles per step/handoff |

### Identity Layer

The agent's **identity is permanent**. It includes:

- Agent ticket (created once, never deleted)
- CV chain (work history accumulates across all assignments)
- Mailbox and attribution record

Identity survives all session cycles and sandbox resets. In the HOP model, this IS
the agent — everything else is infrastructure that comes and goes. See
[Agent Identity](#agent-identity) below for details.

### Session Layer

The Claude session is **ephemeral**. It cycles frequently:

- After each molecule step (via `gt handoff`)
- On context compaction
- On crash/timeout
- After extended work periods

**Key insight:** Session cycling is **normal operation**, not failure. The agent
continues working—only the Claude context refreshes.

```
Session 1: Steps 1-2 → handoff
Session 2: Steps 3-4 → handoff
Session 3: Step 5 → gt done
```

All three sessions are the **same agent**. The sandbox persists throughout.

### Sandbox Layer

The sandbox is the **git worktree**—the agent's working directory:

```
~/gt/gastown/agents/Toast/
```

This worktree:
- Exists from first `gt sling` and persists across assignments
- Survives all session cycles
- Is repaired (reset to fresh branch from main) when reused by `gt sling`
- Contains uncommitted work, staged changes, branch state during active work

The QA Engineer never destroys sandboxes. Only explicit `gt agent nuke` removes them.

#### Sandbox Sync (Between Assignments)

When work completes and the agent goes idle, the sandbox is synced to main:

```bash
# In the agent's worktree (done automatically by gt done / gt sling)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -D agent/<name>/<old-ticket>@<timestamp>
# Worktree is now clean, on main, ready for next assignment
```

When new work is slung:
```bash
# Create fresh branch from current main
git checkout -b agent/<name>/<new-ticket>@<timestamp>
# Start working
```

No worktree add/remove between assignments. Just branch operations on an
existing worktree. This avoids the ~5s overhead of creating fresh worktrees.

### Slot Layer

The slot is the **name allocation** from the agent pool:

```bash
# Pool: [Toast, Shadow, Copper, Ash, Storm...]
# Toast is allocated to work gt-abc
```

The slot:
- Determines the sandbox path (`agents/Toast/`)
- Maps to a tmux session (`gt-gastown-Toast`)
- Appears in attribution (`gastown/agents/Toast`)
- Persists until explicit nuke

## What "Recycle" Means

**Session cycling**: Normal. Claude restarts, sandbox stays, slot stays.

```bash
gt handoff  # Session cycles, agent continues
```

**Sandbox repair**: On reuse. `gt sling` resets the worktree to a fresh branch.

```bash
gt sling gt-xyz gastown  # Reuses idle Toast, repairs worktree
```

Session cycling happens constantly. Sandbox repair happens between assignments.

## Anti-Patterns

### Manual State Transitions

**Anti-pattern:**
```bash
gt agent done Toast    # DON'T: external state manipulation
gt agent reset Toast   # DON'T: manual lifecycle control
```

**Correct:**
```bash
# Agent signals its own completion:
gt done  # (from inside the agent session)

# Only explicit nuke destroys agents:
gt agent nuke Toast  # (destroys sandbox, identity persists)
```

Agents manage their own session lifecycle. External manipulation bypasses verification.

### Sandboxes Without Work (Idle vs Stalled)

An idle agent has no hook and no session — this is **normal**. It completed
its work and is waiting for the next `gt sling`.

A **stalled** agent has a hook but no session — this is a **failure**:
- The session crashed and wasn't nudged back to life
- The hook was lost during a crash
- State corruption occurred

**Recovery for stalled:**
```bash
# QA Engineer respawns the session in the existing sandbox
# Or, if unrecoverable:
gt agent nuke Toast        # Clean up the stalled agent
gt sling gt-abc gastown      # Respawn with fresh agent
```

### Confusing Session with Sandbox

**Anti-pattern:** Thinking session restart = losing work.

```bash
# Session ends (handoff, crash, compaction)
# Work is NOT lost because:
# - Git commits persist in sandbox
# - Staged changes persist in sandbox
# - Molecule state persists in tickets
# - Hook persists across sessions
```

The new session picks up where the old one left off via `gt prime`.

## Session Lifecycle Details

Sessions cycle for these reasons:

| Tfeatureger | Action | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `gt handoff` | Voluntary | Clean cycle to fresh context |
| Context compaction | Automatic | Forced by Claude Code |
| Crash/timeout | Failure | QA Engineer respawns |
| `gt done` | Completion | Session exits, agent goes idle |

All except `gt done` result in continued work. Only `gt done` signals completion
and transitions the agent to idle.

## QA Engineer Responsibilities

The QA Engineer monitors agents but does NOT:
- Force session cycles (agents self-manage via handoff)
- Interrupt mid-step (unless truly stuck)
- Nuke agents after completion (persistent model)

The QA Engineer DOES:
- Detect and nudge stalled agents (sessions that stopped unexpectedly)
- Clean up zombie agents (sessions where `gt done` failed)
- Respawn crashed sessions
- Handle escalations from stuck agents (agents that explicitly asked for help)

## Agent Identity

**Key insight:** Agent *identity* is permanent; sessions are ephemeral, sandboxes are persistent.

In the HOP model, every entity has a chain (CV) that tracks:
- What work they've done
- Success/failure rates
- Skills demonstrated
- Quality metrics

The agent *name* (Toast, Shadow, etc.) is a slot from a pool — persistent until
explicit nuke. The *agent identity* that executes as that agent accumulates a
work history across all assignments.

```
POLECAT IDENTITY (permanent)      SESSION (ephemeral)     SANDBOX (persistent)
├── CV chain                      ├── Claude instance     ├── Git worktree
├── Work history                  ├── Context window      ├── Branch
├── Skills demonstrated           └── Dies on handoff     └── Repaired on reuse
└── Credit for work                   or gt done              by gt sling
```

This distinction matters for:
- **Attribution** - Who gets credit for the work?
- **Skill routing** - Which agent is best for this task?
- **Cost accounting** - Who pays for inference?
- **Federation** - Agents having their own chains in a distributed world
